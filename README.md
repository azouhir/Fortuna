Fortuna is the name of the game as well as the name of the spaceship of our main character, the name 
Fortuna literally means luck, ironic if we think about the unluck that the main character goes through. 
The game story focuses on Timo a young astronaut that is sent from earth to explore Samaha, a possibly 
habitable planet in the near galaxy Proxima Centauri. However, during his journey Timo loses control of 
his spaceship and finds himself stranded in an unknown planet in the galaxy. Timo is the typical astronaut 
who feels the need to conclude his mission therefore he needs to find his spaceship to get back on track 
and reach Samaha. However, the planet he is stuck in is full of aversities and poisonous creatures, Timo 
must overcome all the obstacles to finally find himself face to face with a biomechanical creature. The 
plot twist suggests that previous intelligent life form has been on that planet because no animal could 
possibly build himself mechanical legs. Timo has to fight for his life and for the mission and finally 
after defeating the monster he can gain access again to his spaceship and reach Samaha as planned.

Fortuna is a 2D platformer. The storyline is intriguing and targets a wide variety of gamers, but more specifically it focuses on 
single player gamers with a keen interest in sci-fi type elements. Although some game mechanics are 
lacking in development, for example player can get stuck on any object in the foreground as long as 
the directional button is pressed, the game still presents itself as a fun and enjoyable experience. 
The fact that the fire balls are directly shot from Timo’s spacesuit and not from a weapon suggests 
lacking in design sprites, however the animation is still pleasant to the eye and the explosion effect is 
smooth and enjoyable. The whole game soundtrack is not a real soundtrack but instead a set of wind 
noises that accompany Timo throughout his adventure, which in my opinion makes the whole 
atmosphere spooky and ambiguous. Sounds are also added to each fire ball fired from Timo, a 
pleasant laser sound that adds a nice touch to the sci-fi characteristic of the game. Moreover, Timo 
produces a distress sound when hurt which is accompanied by a bloody image all around the screen. 
UI elements present in the game are basic but fairly intuitive the health bar of Timo is a rectangular 
box which decreases as we get hit by adversities in the game, it could have been more elaborated,
but it does the trick. The design overall is the key element of this game, Timo’s animations are 
smooth and pleasant and transitions from one animation to another are also smooth leaving no 
space to lags or freeze frames. Furthermore, the in-game environment is very basic, repetitive
decorations are present, a few harmful objects and a black background, I believe that more work 
could have gone into the in-game decoration but the choice of a minimalistic environment it is well 
linked to the story and to the forgotten type like planet. Finally, the boss fight a final level before the 
win, the boss is intriguing and the idea of a biotech being introduces more plots for the narrative 
side of the game, and it also introduces the idea of previous alien life in the planet that produced 
these genetically modified animals to serve some kind of purpose. Nevertheless, Timo must defeat 
the monstruous animal to finally get back to the Fortuna. The storyline is ambiguous and leaves a lot 
of doors open for a reason, gamers are more likely to play a sequel of the game to find out if Timo 
makes it to “Samaha” and to discover more clues about the planet we have been stranded on.
